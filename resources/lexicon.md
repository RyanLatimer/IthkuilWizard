Currently, the lexicon below lists over 900 roots, each of which contains 18 stems, for a total of 16200 stems (see Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 10.1.1 for an explanation of the structure of individual roots and their 18 stems). This represents approximately one-fourth of the roots in the language. Additional roots and their stems will be periodically added to this list as time permits.

(NOTE: The above "Supplement to Lexicon" link presents a PDF file of approximately 85 additional lexical roots and their associated stems.)

The reader should be aware that the glosses (i.e., the English translations or definitions) for each of the stems below are at times somewhat arbitrary, as Ithkuil roots and their stems have been conceptualized from the cognitive level up, without regard as to whether they correspond necessarily to an existing word or phrase in English or other languages. As a result, some of the English glosses chosen as representations for the Ithkuil stems are approximations at best.

Ideally, the best way to represent the meanings of Ithkuil stems would be to use a semantic “meta-language” comprised of a closed set of semantically universal (or near-universal) “primitives” to create semantic “formulas” which define the use of a particular stem. (The design and use of such a meta-language to translate the meanings of words from one language to another can be found in the writings of linguist Anna Wierzbicka.) However, the author has chosen not to pursue such an effort for the sake of time, as such an analysis would likely take decades to complete.

In regard to the list below, note that in some cases both a nominal (i.e., noun) and verbal gloss have been provided, while in others only one or the other is present. Nevertheless, the reader should keep in mind at all times that Ithkuil stems always convey both a nominal and verbal meaning, as explained in detail in Section 2.4.1.

The lexicon is arranged in the following alphabetical order:

    B C C’ Ch Ç Č Č’ Čh D Dh F G J K K’ Kh L Ļ M N Ň P P’ Ph Q Q’ Qh R Ř S Š T T’ Th Ţ V X Xh Z Ż Ž

It should also be noted that in previous versions of the language, formative roots were divided into lexico-semantic “classes” designated by the phonological patterning of the root (there were 17 such classes in the original version of Ithkuil, ten such classes in Ilaksh). In the current version of the language, these lexico-semantic classes have been eliminated, as the author has realized that the establishment of such classes does not serve any functional purpose in “real-world” spoken/written contexts; the ability to identify the semantic class of a stem does not sufficiently aid in understanding the stem’s specific meaning. Therefore, the assignment of phoneme patterns to roots in Ithkuil is now arbitrary. While the astute reader will note that many roots pertaining to a specific semantic notion (e.g., animals, plant and substance taxonomies, spatial position, etc.) still have similar phonological patterning, such patterning is nevertheless merely incidental and is without formal significance.

 
Note on Ithkuil's Implicit “Theory of Meaning”

For those readers who may be trained in linguistics, particulary cognitive linguistics, it should be noted that at this point in the author’s development of the language, a traditional Enlightenment-based theory of meaning, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between a lexeme and its external “in-the-world” referent, has been implicitly assumed for convenience and/or expediency’s sake. A more careful and rigourous construction for Ithkuil’s lexico-semantics, given the author’s stated design goals (as described in the Introduction section), would not assume such a theory of meaning, but would rather incorporate more recent findings of cognitive science and cognitive linguistics to reflect embodied meaning and metaphor-based conceptualization. However, pursuing such a foundation for the lexico-semantics of the language would, in the author’s opinion, be extremely time-consuming (on the order of many additional years, perhaps decades, to construct). Rather than withdraw the language from public availability for such reasons, the author has chosen instead to adopt a traditional/formalist foundation for its lexico-semantics essentially out of convenience, in order to be able to showcase the language's morphology.

Note also that the speaker should take care to utilize Version categories carefully with these stems (especially when using the holistic stems), in order to distinguish whether or not the person seeking pardon, forgiveness, etc., is, in fact, pardoned, forgiven, etc.  Likewise, the speaker should consider whether it is appropriate to utilize a Valence category when using these stems, given that their semantics naturally entail the actions/states of two parties

The following important notes apply to use of the above stems:

P1/S2, P2/S2, and P3/S2 all have the following derivatives using the SSD1 suffix indicating a quark’s “flavor” and “color”:
1) up
2) charm
3) top
4) red
5) green
6) blue
7) bottom
8) strange
9) down

Informal stems P1/S3, P2/S3, and P3/S3 all have the following derivatives using the SSD1 suffix identifying the particular type of lepton (or anti-lepton):
1) muon
2) charged lepton (i.e., non-neutrino lepton)
3) tau lepton, tauon
4)
5) electron
6) electron neutrino
7) muon neutrino
8) tau neutrino
9) neutrino (i.e., any of the three types)

Formal stems P1/S1, P2/S1, and P3/S1 all have the following derivatives using the SSD1 suffix identifying the particular type of boson and/or its associated interaction or “force” :
1) graviton/gravity
2) weak gauge boson (i.e., either the W+, the W-, or the Z) / the weak interaction or force
3) photon [as associated with electrical phenomenon] / electricity
4) W+ boson / the weak interaction or force as mediated by the W+ boson (use PLV1/1 suffix to indicate the W- boson)
5) photon / electromagnetism
6) Z-zero boson / the weak interaction or force as mediated by the Z-zero boson
7) photon [as associated with magnetic phenomenon] / magnetism
8) Higgs boson / Higgs mechanism
9) gluon / the strong interaction or color force

Use of the SSD2/5 suffix with the above stems identifies the supersymetrical partner of the particular particle (i.e., its “sparticle” counterpart), e.g., photino, gluino, gravitino, slepton, squark, sneutrino, etc.

It should be noted that when using the above stems to refer to forces (e.g., gravity or electromagnetism), one must realize that the individual stems refer to a particular instance of force/interaction from a single (i.e., particular) particle.  One must inflect the stem appropriately as for Configuration, Association, Perspective, etc., when speaking of “the force of gravity” or “electricity” as a generic concept.

NOTE:  In Ithkuil, guns, catapults, slings and all other firearms or devices for shooting/hurling projectiles utilize Degree 1 of the UTE suffix ('tool/implement for doing X'), as it is not the firearm/shooting device that kills but the projectile shot/fired from it. Thus a gun is a "bullet-implementer".  Care must be taken in assigning appropriate noun Cases or verbal Formats to stems associated with ballistic aerial weapons to distinguish the fact that it is the projectile that is the actual "weapon" and not the object it was fired/projected from. This is the good old "shoot bullets" vs. "shoot guns" vs. "shoot bullets from a gun" vs. "shoot him with a gun" vs. "shoot him with bullets from a gun" problem . This would translate into Ithkuil as "I bulleted him due to/enabled by a gun" or incorparatively as "I gun-bulleted him" using either the RESULTATIVE Format (literally translating as "I bulleted him as a result of concurrently gun-activating") or the INSTRUMENTATIVE Format (literally translating as "I bulleted him by the enabling means of gun-activating").
