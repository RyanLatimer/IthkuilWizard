As we have seen in previous chapters, Ithkuil, like most languages, employs affixes (including both prefixes, suffixes, and infixes) in its morphology. However, one type of affix to the formative, the Vx+C suffix from Slot XI, operates in a manner warranting separate analysis. This chapter describes the morpho-phonological structure of these Vx+C suffixes (how they are formed from consonants and vowels), as well as their function.

7.1 VxC SUFFIXES

All Ithkuil affixes we have analyzed up to this point, whether prefixes or infixes, have consisted of either a single vocalic form (i.e., a single vowel, a diphthong, or a dyssyllabic vocalic conjunct), or a single consonantal form (i.e., a single consonant, a geminated consonant, or a consonant cluster), each of which has been invariable in its form. Furthermore, we have found that only one such affix can occupy its given slot in the formative’s structure.

However, the VxC suffix from Slot XI is different in three respects: (1) it is comprised of both a vowel form and a consonantal form, (2) the vocalic portion of the suffix can mutate, and (3) more than one VxC suffix can occupy Slot XI in the formative (i.e., VxC suffixes can be strung together sequentially one after the other).

7.1.1 Mutation of the Vowel Vx

While the consonantal portion of the suffix, C, is always invariable, the vocalic portion Vx mutates depending on two morphological factors known as degree and suffix-type. The nine different degrees will be discussed in detail in the next section below. As for suffix-type, every consonantal-based Vx+C suffix falls into one of three types, which determine what vowel or vowels will come before the invariable consonant C. The three suffix-types are labelled V1, V2, and V3, in reference to the vowel portion of the suffix.

7.1.2 Degree And Degree-Shifting

In addition to the three suffix-types, the vowel(s) associated with suffixes are also determined by degree. There are nine degrees, each of which has three associated vowel infixes corresponding to the three suffix-types. Table 24 below shows the vowel(s) associated with each suffix-type.

As for the morpho-syntactic function of Degree, it is used in Ithkuil to create a gradient system for all consonantal suffixes, which generally indicates the degree to which the semantic concept underlying the particular suffix applies to the particular stem. This gradient usually extends from zero-degree (i.e., the particular concept or quality is absent or minimal) to a maximal degree (i.e., the particular concept or quality is present in totality). We will see in the tables of suffixes in Section 7.4 how this gradient system is used systematically in many dynamic semantic contexts. As a preview we can illustrate the meanings associated with the nine degrees for the suffix -V1d.

  	
Degree

1
	-id 	wholly lacking in / a complete absence of / not at all
  	
2
	-öd 	way too little / totally insufficient(ly) / not anywhere enough
  	
3
	-ed 	not enough / insufficient(ly) / under-[+verb]
  	
4
	-îd 	not quite enough / somewhat insufficient(ly) / slightly under-[+verb]
  	
5
	-ad 	enough (of) / sufficient(ly)
  	
6
	-ûd 	a little too (much) / more than needed / slightly over-[+verb]
  	
7
	-od 	too / too much / over-[+verb]
  	
8
	-üd 	way too much / totally over-[+verb]
  	
9
	-ud 	nothing but / to the exclusion of all else


There are approximatey 200 different consonantal suffix categories, each of which divides into the nine degrees discussed above to render over 1800 distinct suffixes. Each degree of a suffix has a distinct meaning, often representing a point along a continuum in terms of how much or how little the underlying semantic sense of the suffix category is being manifested by the particular formative.

It is important to remember that, since all morpho-semantic stems are both nominal and verbal in meaning, all suffixes to a stem have both a nominal and a verbal meaning. Therefore, the choice whether to translate the suffixes below into their nominal or verbal meaning is entirely dependent on the morpho-syntactical structure of the word within the context of its use in a phrase or sentence as a whole.


7.1.3 Notational Scheme

For convenience’ sake, when referring to a particular suffix of specific type and degree, we will use the notation in the section above, utilizing a V for the variable vocalic component, a subscript 1, 2, or 3 indicating the suffix-type, followed by a slash and a number indicating the degree. Thus, the suffix -nt of Type 1 and 4th degree will be written -V1nt/4, while the suffix -r of Type 3 and 8th degree will be written -V3r/8, and so forth.



7.2 SUFFIX-TYPES

Each suffix category comes in three types, numbered 1, 2, and 3, indicated by variances in the initial vocalic component of the suffix. Use of the Type 1 version of a suffix caries a mere circumstantial meaning applicable to the context at hand in a subjectively incidental, happenstance, temporary, or informal manner, whereas the Type 2 version of a suffix implies a derivational meaning which can entail lexical differences when translating into English.

For example, the Type 1 suffix -up, i.e., -V1p/9, and its Type 2 counterpart -uip , i.e., -V2p/9, which both mean ‘exactly similar to…/identical…,’ the difference in usage being that the Type 1 suffix conveys merely a circumstantial or incidental similarity, while the Type 2 suffix implies that the similarity is an integral aspect of the word. In English, such a distinction would most likely be conveyed by using a different word. For example, note the difference when we add these two suffixes to the Ithkuil word eqal ‘person’: eqalup means ‘identical-looking person,’ whereas eqaluip means ‘twin.’ In this way, we can say that the suffix -Vp with Type 1 vocalic infixes conveys a circumstantial application of its meaning to a stem, while with Type 2 vocalic infixes, it conveys a derivational application of its meaning (i.e., wholly new concepts or words are derived from the stem).

As for Type 3 suffixes, these are used in circumstances where the meaning of the suffix is meant to be applied not to the formative itself, but rather to the immediately adjacent suffix. This is somewhat analogous to the way that adverbs can be used to modify descriptive adjectives in English. For example, in the phrase suddenly blue sky, it is the blueness that is sudden, not the sky. In Ithkuil, Type 3 suffixes modify another suffix (usually the one following, unless there are only two suffixes on the stem, in which case the suffix order is irrelevant); this is done by using Type 3 vocalic infixes. For example, the suffix -Vd/5, which means ‘enough / sufficient(ly),’ can be used both circumstantially (using Type 1 infixes) and derivationally (using Type 2 infixes) to modify a stem, or can be used to modify only the adjacent suffix (using Type 3 infixes). Such suffixes must immediately precede the suffix they are modifying, unless they are in word-final position, in which case they modify the immediately preceding suffix. This is illustrated below:

    eqalad: ‘a sufficient person’ (i.e., one able to perform the task at hand)
    eqalâd: ‘a recruit’ (i.e., one able to meet performance or entry requirements)
    eqalüadûx: ‘a sufficiently large person’ (where suffix -V1x/6 = ‘large’)

 


7.2.1 Multiple Suffixation and Ordering of Suffixes

When adding two or more suffixes to a stem, the suffixes generally can be added to the stem in any order desired, with the exception of V3C suffixes which modify an adjacent suffix. This latter type must precede the suffix it modifies, unless there are only two VxC suffixes to the word, in which case the order is irrelevant.



7.3 SPECIAL USE OF V3C SUFFIXES

Note that when a Type 3 suffix appears alone in Slot XI, unaccompanied by another VxC suffix, it serves a different purpose than normal. Such lone Type 3 suffixes are used as “short-cut” ways of displaying a type of adunct we will discuss in Chapter 8, called a personal reference adjunct. In these cases, the consonant portion of the suffix, rather than repesenting its usual suffix category, instead corresponds to one of the numerous personal reference categories we will discuss in Chapter 8, while the vowel portion of the suffix, rather than corresponding to one of nine degrees, instead correponds to one of nine noun cases. The details for utilizing these special V3C suffixes are discussed in Section 8.1.5.



7.4 LIST OF SUFFIXES

The 200 suffix categories are listed in the sections which follow, indicating the difference in meaning for each of the nine degrees. Recall that each of these suffixes may (theoretically) function as both Type 1 and Type 2 suffixes, the latter type often entailing a change of meaning or lexical shift when translating into English.

7.4.2 Deictic Suffixes

Deictic suffixes refer to the grammatical process of deixis, the act of pointing to or pointing out. The suffixes correspond to the different variants of the concepts of ‘here’ and ‘there.’ In Ithkuil, distinctions are made in these suffixes as to whether a referent is near the speaker, near the listener, distant from both, whether it is observable or accessible, and in some case, whether it is alienable or inalienable (i.e., whether the entity can be separated from the associated person).

The V1 value of these suffixes merely indicates sequential position on the calendar, e.g., llalirl 'the first day of the week,' whereas V2 values give the names of the days of the weeks, days of the month, months of the year, etc., e.g., llaluarl 'Sunday,' ksaluarl 'Monday,' ksalârl 'February,' llalökearl 'the 21st Century', mřalik (ňial) xmalukeorl 'the year 1999.'

Note: the CAL suffix inherently conveys Functional (FNC) Context, since calendrical notions are, of course, societal conventions as opposed to being natural ontological concepts. Therefore, for formatives carrying the CAL suffix it is not necessary to inflect for FNC Context.

-ř 	
NA3
	Negation/affirmation of all morphological components except Modality
-řř 	
NA4
	Negation/affirmation of all but aspectual or Modality information

The above four suffixes are used to affirm or negate a formative. Because much of the information associated with an Ithkuil formative is carried in adjuncts, the above suffixes are used to indicate exactly which morpho-semantic information is being affirmed or negated. For example, in English the sentences I don’t want to stop eating, I want to not stop eating, and I want to stop not eating mean different things. The above four suffixes are used with the following degrees.
Degree 1 	on the contrary…most cerainly does NOT/is NOT [absolute negation]; no X whatsoever; absolutely not = emphatic negation/denial
Degree 2 	on the contrary…does NOT or is NOT [absolute negation contrary to expectation]
Degree 3 	on the contrary…does NOT or is NOT [relative negation contrary to expectation]
Degree 4 	no; not [absolute negation] = e.g., I will not win the race (because I’m not in the race)
Degree 5 	no; not [relative negation] = e.g., I will not win the race (although I am in the race)

7.4.11 Modality Suffixes

Many of these correspond to the modality suffixes used in valence/modality adjuncts (see Chapter 6). The nine degrees associated with each suffix allow a speaker control over the extent to which the modality category should apply to the utterance. These suffix forms function, then, as an alternative to adjunct forms for greater nuance in the applicability of the modality category and to apply them to nouns. The nine degrees of each suffix are as follows:
Degree 1 	not at all
Degree 2 	to too little a degree; to an insufficient degree
Degree 3 	hardly at all
Degree 4 	to a small degree
Degree 5 	to a fair degree/somewhat

WAK
	Spread/wake/trail/area/expanse created by passage of entity
Degree 1 	quasi-linear “trail” or wake left behind on path of linear movement; trail or wake is not composed of the moving entity itself but shows effect of its passage (e.g., slime trail left by snail, footprints left on snow, mowed down foliage left by moving convoy, etc.)
Degree 2 	quasi-linear spread of entity stretching behind linearly moving “head” (e.g., a line of soldiers put in place to create a front, a line left on a piece of paper as written by an ink pen, path of a ball of string or skein of yarn as it unravels while rolling down an incline)
Degree 3 	quasi-linear trail/wake/spread left behind passage as line of demarcation/boundary/barrier
Degree 4 	2-d quasi-planar wake left behind on path of movement; wake is not composed of the moving entity itself but shows effect of its passage (e.g., aftermath of a forest fire, cleaned area of dirty floor or wall after it has been wiped by a mop or dustcloth)
Degree 5 	2-d quasi-planar spread stretching behind moving front (e.g., area of spreading flames in a forest fire, area being inundated by a flood, area of a wall being covered up by plaster by workmen, coating of an apple dipped in chocolate, area of floor covered up by a rug)
Degree 6 	2-d quasi-planar wake/spread left behind passage as area of demarcation/zone/restricted area
Degree 7 	3-d volume left behind a moving front; volume is not composed of or inundated with the moving entity itself but shows effect of its passage (e.g., area left behind the passage of a tidal wave, column of superheated air left behind the passage of a rocket
Degree 8 	3-d volume inundated by spread of moving front (e.g., spread of a gas within a room, area inundated by fog, volume of a container taken up by substance placed/poured/stuffed into it)
Degree 9 	3-d volume left behind passage of moving front as volume/spatial area of demarcation/zone/restricted space

The above affix distinguishes movement of an entity from the “trail” or spread left behind, e.g., movement which leaves behind a wake or affected area; used with motion roots as well as roots designating shapes/forms. Use of the above suffixes in conjunction with the various roots pertaining to paths of translative movement allows for very nuanced translations of English words such as surround, cover, inundate, enclose, expand, spread out, encompass, etc.

7.4.15   Format Expansion Suffixes

These VxC suffixes were first mentioned in Section 6.4.3 and are used in conjunction with the Vf Format/Context suffix in Slot XII to accomplish the following:

    Specify the Configuration and Perspective of an incorporated stem (see Sec. 6.4)
    Expand the category of Format (see Sec. 6.4.1) so that it is associated with the 72 primary noun cases (see Chapter 4), i.e., so that the semantically conflated relationship of the incorporated stem to the main stem of the formative can be specifically defined by a noun case.  For example, the Format of an incorporated stem ‘cat’ can be marked as INDUCIVE case (see Sec. 4.3.2) in conjunction with the main stem ‘vocalize’ to give a word meaning ‘meow.’

 

Twelve consonant forms are used for these Slot XI suffixes, which combine with the three suffix-types to give the 36 forms necessary to specify the nine possible configurations and four possible perspectives of the incorporated stem.  In turn, the nine suffix-degrees times eight vocalic Vf suffixes in Slot XII combine to identify which of the 72 primary noun cases constitutes the Format of the incorporated stem.  All these forms are shown in the matrices below.
